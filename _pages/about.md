My name is Wenjie Li, and I am a third-year undergraduate student from [Hainan University](https://www.hainanu.edu.cn/). My main research interests are underwater computer vision, low-level vision, and medical image processing.

I am very fortunate to be guided by [Professor Hua Li](https://cs.hainanu.edu.cn/info/1105/1895.htm) at the School of Computer Science, Hainan University.

You can find my CV here: [Wenjie Li's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).

**I’m actively seeking opportunities to pursue a Master’s degree starting from Fall 2024.**
